# About the Project
## Goals
Predict the water level in a waterbody to handle daily consumption and therefor improve water preservation. While the data consists of nine seperate waterbodies with different features, it is still important to understand the water levels as a whole in order to preserve water for the entire country of Italy. To be concise, the goal is to build a story to predict the amount of water in each unique waterbody, ensuring water availability for each time interval of the year.

## Background
According to the Kaggle competition overview [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/acea-water-prediction/overview),
> "The Acea Group is one of the leading Italian multiutility operators. Listed on the Italian Stock Exchange since 1999, the company manages and develops water and 
> electricity networks and environmental services. Acea is the foremost Italian operator in the water services sector supplying 9 million inhabitants in Lazio, 
> Tuscany, Umbria, Molise, Campania."

## Deliverables
- A notebook that can generate four mathematical models, one for each category of waterbody (acquifers, water springs, river, lake) that might be applicable to each single waterbody
